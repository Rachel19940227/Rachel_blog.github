My first computer course was CS50, which is an introductory course suitable for beginners. Although it is an introductory course, it covers a wide range of knowledge and is suitable for beginners to understand the basic concepts of computers and explore programming languages such as C and python.

1. What to study in CS50?

CS50 is a basic programming course. In short, you will learn a little bit of everything, including C and Python (programming), SQL (database), HTML (webpage design), etc., to pave the way for you in computing ðŸ™‰

2. Who is suitable to study?

Suitable for beginners. If you find it difficult, you can take a look at Crash Course Computer Science first. It is also suitable for beginners because its homework part is differentiated.

3. How long does it take to study?

Of course, this is a matter of opinion. If calculated in terms of hours, the lecture part of each class is 3 hours and the homework part is 4-20 hours.

Therefore, if you want to browse quickly, you can finish a class in 7 hours at the fastest. If you want to study carefully, 20 hours in a class is not too much. There are 12 lessons in the entire course. Based on 4 hours of focused study every day, it can take as long as 60 days or as little as 20 days, depending on everyoneâ€™s plan.

4. Whatâ€™s so good about it?

As a public elective course, its original design intention is to attract students regardless of major to learn about CS and become interested in CS. Judging from the realization of this goal, CS50 can be called a phenomenon. Since its launch in 2006, more than four million people have registered; YouTube has more than one million subscribers, and this cat head is also active on ins/discord and other platforms
