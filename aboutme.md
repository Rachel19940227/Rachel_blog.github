My name is Rachel Zu. I am a Computer Programming student at Algonquin College with GPA 4.0/4.0, engaging in coding projects that demonstrate my proficiency in Java, web development and Database.

My experience as an Product Manager at iFLYTEK Co. Ltd for 5 years, which honed my soft skills in cross-functional teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. I designed products based on business usage scenarios and provided project management, leading to an increase in engagement and successful revenue growth initiatives.

As I seek a co-op position starting in Sept 2024, I am eager to apply my technical expertise and collaborative approach to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects and drive continuous learning and growth within a dynamic team environment.
